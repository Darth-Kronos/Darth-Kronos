I am a graduate student at North Carolina State University pursuing my masters in electrical engineering with a focus on machine learning and computer vision. I have a strong background in Python and am skilled in using PyTorch and TensorFlow for building deep learning models. Additionally, I have experience in deploying cloud solutions using AWS, and I am always eager to learn about new ways to deploy scalable ML solutions in the cloud.

Additionally, I am delving into accelerating Machine Learning models. Presently, I am engaged in the process of enhancing Panoptic segmentation through the utilization of TensorRT for optimization.
