I am a graduate student at North Carolina State University pursuing my masters in electrical engineering with a focus on machine learning and computer vision. I have a strong background in Python and am skilled in using PyTorch and TensorFlow for building deep learning models. Additionally, I have experience in deploying cloud solutions using AWS, and I am always eager to learn about new ways to deploy scalable ML solutions in the cloud.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a lot of assignments from college
- 🚀 Getting my hands dirty with Generative AI and NLP
- 📖 I’m currently reading [Designing Machine Learning Systems](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-machine-learning/9781098107956/) by  Chip Huyen; Loving this book 💗
- 🤔 I’m looking for Fall 2023 Co-op in the field of Machine learning
